        <h3>Original Processor</h3>
        <p class = sub>Made a working multi-cycle processor over 7 weeks with a team of 3. The project involved Creating our own Architecture and coding language for the processor. We also needed a full design document that would allow anyone to be able to use our processor.</p>
        <p class = sub>The architechture was created by using Quartus to simulate our design</p>

        <h3>“Joust”</h3>
        <p class = sub>Recreated the arcade game "Joust" ina team of 3. We had to match the game's original functionality and add a new feature of our own. My team decided we would create darkness the would only allow the player to see what's close to them.</p>
        <p class = sub>We used Java on Eclipse and the Java.Swing class as the display.</p>
